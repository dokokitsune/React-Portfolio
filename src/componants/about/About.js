          My name is Weston Wood. I am currently a Junior at California State University, Los Angeles
          and a Web Officer for the Assosiation for Computing Machinery (ACM) on Campus. After college
          I want to persue a Backend Web-development job or a Dev-ops engineer job. In my free time I work
          on learning new skills for my future career.
